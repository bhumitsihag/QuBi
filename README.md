QuBi is a toy quantum circuit simulator, intended to help people in learning about quantum computing.

If you want to quickly explore the behavior of a small quantum circuit, QuBi is the tool for you.
QuBi assumes you already know background facts like "each wire represents a qubit".)

**Defining features**:

- Runs in web browsers.
- Drag-and-drop circuit editing.
- Reacts, simulates, and animates in real time.
- Inline state displays.
- Bookmarkable / linkable circuits.
- Up to 16 qubits.

# Examples
